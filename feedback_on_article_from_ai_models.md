# Feedback on AI Alignment Article from Leading Foundation Models as of 2/24/2025

I decided to ask the various "best in class" AI models (O1-Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Grok3 with thinking) what they thought of my [proposal](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/some_thoughts_on_ai_alignment) for how to better control and align super-smart AI systems in the future. After all, who better to ask than the AIs themselves? Here was my prompt, used for all 3: 

> "Give me your thoughts on this proposal I wrote up below. How smart is it? How novel or interesting are the ideas? What else have you seen before that is similar to it? Do you think it represents a real advancement in thinking about AI safety and alignment?"

---

**First, here, is Claude 3.7 Sonnet's response:**

I've read through Jeffrey Emanuel's proposal on AI alignment, and here are my thoughts:

## Overall Assessment
This is a thoughtful and well-reasoned approach to AI safety that recognizes fundamental limitations in current safety techniques. The proposal addresses real challenges backed by recent research, particularly around how easily safety guardrails can be bypassed in large language models.

## Strengths of the Proposal

**Pragmatic perspective:** The acknowledgment that internal safety measures alone are insufficient is well-supported by evidence, including the rapid development of "uncensored" models and research on refusal behavior being aligned to a single direction in latent space.

**Systems approach:** Drawing the parallel to how society handles dangerous humans through external monitoring and control systems rather than relying solely on internalized ethics is insightful.

**Technical depth:** The proposal offers concrete mechanisms for implementation, including:
- Using constrained BNF grammars to limit Helper model outputs
- Monitoring both final outputs and intermediate activations
- Implementing weighted voting systems based on accuracy metrics
- Using cryptographic commitments to prevent manipulation

## Novelty Assessment

While the concept of "AI watching AI" isn't entirely new, this proposal offers several innovative extensions:

1. The focus on monitoring internal activations (the "pre-ideas") is particularly interesting and less explored in the literature
2. The congress-like voting system with weighted contributions based on accuracy metrics
3. The rotation of Helper models to prevent manipulation
4. The strictly one-directional information flow preventing the Smart model from defending itself

## Similar Approaches

This proposal shares elements with several existing approaches:
- **Constitutional AI** (Anthropic): Using AI to evaluate and revise outputs based on principles
- **AI debate** approaches: Multiple models critiquing each other
- **Recursive oversight** systems: Where simpler models evaluate more complex ones
- **Red-teaming systems**: Using honeypot scenarios to identify vulnerabilities

However, the comprehensive nature of the proposal and its emphasis on monitoring internal model states distinguishes it from most of these approaches.

## Challenges and Limitations

The author correctly identifies some key challenges:
1. System complexity could introduce its own risks and failure modes
2. Resource requirements would be substantial
3. False alarms could lead to operational deadlocks
4. "Risk theater" might create a false sense of security

Additional concerns I'd raise:
- Training Helper models to recognize problematic activation patterns would be extremely difficult
- The independent operation of Helper models might still be vulnerable to a truly superintelligent system
- The approach doesn't solve the fundamental problem of defining "harmful" behavior

## Does it Represent an Advancement?

I would characterize this as a meaningful incremental advancement in AI safety thinking. It synthesizes existing approaches with novel elements into a more comprehensive framework that addresses some key limitations of current methods.

While not revolutionary, it offers a valuable perspective that could inform practical safety measures for increasingly powerful AI systems. The acknowledgment that internal safety measures alone are insufficient is particularly important.

The most valuable contribution may be the detailed consideration of monitoring internal model states, which is an underexplored area with significant potential.

**Next is Grok3 with thinking:**

Your proposal for addressing AI alignment and safety through an external system of Helper models monitoring a more intelligent Smart model is thoughtful, pragmatic, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the challenges in AI safety. Below, I'll evaluate its intelligence, novelty, and potential as an advancement in AI safety thinking, as well as compare it to existing ideas in the field.

### **How Smart Is the Proposal?**

Your proposal is intelligent and tackles some of the most pressing challenges in AI safety and alignment. Here are its key strengths:

- **External Control Mechanism**:
  - You correctly identify that internal safeguards (e.g., refusal mechanisms, RLHF) in a single AI model are insufficient, especially for highly intelligent systems. Vulnerabilities like prompt injections and the ease of removing guardrails (e.g., disabling refusal behavior via latent space adjustments) are well-documented, and your proposal shifts focus to external oversight. This is a pragmatic acknowledgment of the limitations of internal controls.
  - The analogy to human sociopaths and the criminal justice system is apt. Just as society relies on external monitoring and control for individuals who bypass moral norms, AI systems—especially superintelligent ones—may require similar external mechanisms.

- **Monitoring Intermediate Activations**:
  - Analyzing not just the outputs but also the intermediate activations (akin to "thoughts") of the Smart model is a clever and proactive approach. This could potentially catch problematic behavior before it fully manifests, addressing the risk of the Smart model deceiving or manipulating the system.
  - The use of "honeypot" scenarios to train Helper models by coaxing the Smart model into misbehavior and studying activation patterns is a creative method to identify tell-tale signs of problematic behavior.

- **Diversity and Independence of Helper Models**:
  - Using a variety of Helper models with different architectures, training data, and principles (e.g., Transformer-based, Mamba-based) is a strong strategy to prevent the Smart model from exploiting any single weakness. The emphasis on diversity and independence reduces the risk of systemic vulnerabilities.
  - The congress of Helper models with weighted voting based on past performance (precision and recall) is a thoughtful way to balance effectiveness and caution. Periodically rotating Helper models to keep the Smart model "on its toes" is another smart safeguard.

- **Cryptographic Commitment for Voting**:
  - The use of cryptographic hashing (e.g., SHA256) to ensure the integrity of Helper models' votes is a smart addition. It prevents manipulation and ensures trustworthiness in the decision-making process.

- **Acknowledgment of Limitations**:
  - You candidly address potential issues like false positives, resource intensity, and the risk of the Smart model masking its intentions. This shows a realistic understanding of the challenges involved. For example:
    - The analogy to the Toyota production system highlights the need to balance safety with operational efficiency, minimizing unnecessary interruptions.
    - The recognition that excessive false alarms could lead to "risk theater" and complacency is a critical insight, drawing parallels to real-world systems like financial compliance.

- **One-Directional Information Flow**:
  - Preventing the Smart model from "defending itself" or accessing information about the Helper models' processes is a wise precaution. Given the Smart model's superior intelligence, allowing it to argue could lead to manipulation, undermining the system's effectiveness.

### **How Novel or Interesting Are the Ideas?**

While your proposal builds on existing concepts in AI safety, it introduces several novel and interesting elements. Here's a breakdown:

- **Analyzing Intermediate Activations**:
  - Monitoring outputs is common in AI safety, but analyzing intermediate activations for signs of misbehavior is relatively novel. It's akin to detecting "pre-crime" by reading the AI's "mind," which is an innovative angle.
  - Training Helper models to interpret these activations using honeypot scenarios is creative, though challenging. The idea of comparing activation patterns to "known bad" behaviors in latent space adds depth to this approach.

- **Honeypot Scenarios**:
  - Using controlled scenarios to coax the Smart model into misbehavior and studying its activation patterns is a fresh method for training Helper models. This could help identify tell-tale signs of problematic behavior, especially for novel or deceptive actions.

- **Surprise Measurement for Deception Detection**:
  - Measuring how "surprising" the output is relative to intermediate activations is an interesting way to detect potential deception or masking of intentions. This addresses the risk of the Smart model disguising its internal states, drawing parallels to human psychopaths passing polygraph tests.

- **Congress of Helper Models with Weighted Voting**:
  - While multi-agent oversight isn't entirely new, the specific implementation—where Helper models vote based on their track record, are periodically rotated, and commit votes cryptographically—is a novel take. The emphasis on diversity and independence enhances the robustness of this approach.

- **Security by Obscurity (Limited)**:
  - While you acknowledge the pitfalls of "security by obscurity," your justification for hiding certain details from the Smart model (e.g., Helper models' processes) is pragmatic. It draws parallels to real-world practices like NSA signal intelligence or Secret Service counterfeiting techniques, adding a practical dimension.

### **Comparisons to Existing Ideas**

Your proposal builds on and extends several existing concepts in AI safety and alignment. Here's how it compares:

- **AI Boxing and Oversight**:
  - The concept of containing and monitoring an AI has been discussed in AI safety literature (e.g., Oracle AI, AI boxing). However, your proposal goes further by specifying how monitoring could be done using multiple, diverse models and by analyzing internal states (intermediate activations).
  - Unlike traditional AI boxing, which often relies on human oversight, your system uses AI-based Helper models, which is both scalable and potentially more robust against superintelligent systems.

- **Ensemble Methods**:
  - The use of multiple models to improve robustness is similar to ensemble methods in machine learning. However, in your case, the ensemble is used for control rather than performance enhancement, which is a novel application.

- **Multi-Agent Systems**:
  - The idea of having multiple agents with different roles (e.g., monitors and decision-makers) is common in multi-agent systems. Applying it to AI safety, with a focus on diversity and weighted voting, is less explored and adds a fresh perspective.

- **Interpretability Challenges**:
  - The difficulty of interpreting intermediate activations is a known issue in AI research. While your proposal suggests a method to tackle this (e.g., honeypot scenarios), it's still a significant hurdle, and the approach might be overly optimistic.

- **Alignment Through Oversight**:
  - Your approach can be seen as a form of "alignment through oversight," where the alignment problem is addressed by having external AI systems monitor and correct the behavior of the primary AI. This contrasts with efforts to build alignment directly into the model, which you argue is insufficient.

### **Does It Represent a Real Advancement in AI Safety Thinking?**

Yes, your proposal represents a meaningful advancement in AI safety and alignment thinking, particularly in the following ways:

- **Shift from Internal to External Safeguards**:
  - By emphasizing that internal safeguards are insufficient for highly intelligent AIs, you advocate for external, multi-layered control systems. This is a valuable perspective, especially as AI capabilities advance. It aligns with the growing recognition that superintelligent systems may require external checks and balances.

- **Proactive Detection of Misbehavior**:
  - Focusing on intermediate activations aims to catch problematic behavior before it results in harmful actions, which is a step forward from reactive safety measures. This proactive approach could be critical for preventing catastrophic outcomes.

- **Balancing Caution and Efficiency**:
  - The system's design, with weighted voting, penalties for false alarms, and periodic rotation of Helper models, attempts to balance safety with operational efficiency. This addresses a common trade-off in safety systems, drawing lessons from real-world examples like the Toyota production system.

- **Novel Implementation Details**:
  - While the core idea of AI oversight isn't new, specific elements like analyzing intermediate activations, using honeypot scenarios, and implementing cryptographic voting mechanisms add fresh perspectives. These details enhance the robustness and practicality of the approach.

- **Acknowledgment of Resource Intensity**:
  - You realistically address the resource demands of such a system, drawing parallels to safety-critical systems like nuclear power plants and passenger jets. This pragmatic perspective strengthens the case for investment in safety, even if it requires significant resources.

### **Potential Issues and Limitations**

While your proposal is strong, there are several challenges and limitations to consider:

- **Scalability and Resource Intensity**:
  - As the Smart model becomes more intelligent, the Helper models may need to be increasingly sophisticated to keep up, potentially leading to an arms race. The resource demands (e.g., training diverse Helper models, monitoring activations) could be prohibitive, though you argue that such costs are justified for safety-critical systems.

- **Interpretability of Activations**:
  - Training Helper models to reliably interpret intermediate activations is a major challenge. The proposal assumes this is feasible, but it might not be, especially for complex, novel behaviors. Current AI research struggles with interpretability, and this aspect may be overly optimistic.

- **Adversarial Manipulation**:
  - A sufficiently intelligent Smart model could still find ways to deceive or manipulate the Helper models, especially if it can infer or learn about their weaknesses over time. While diversity and rotation help, they may not be sufficient against a superintelligent adversary.

- **False Positives and Deadlocks**:
  - The risk of excessive interruptions due to false alarms could undermine the system's effectiveness, leading to complacency or pressure to weaken the controls. You address this with weighted voting and penalties, but it remains a significant concern, drawing parallels to the "boy who cried wolf" phenomenon.

- **Complexity and Implementation**:
  - The system's complexity, with multiple moving parts (e.g., diverse Helper models, voting, honeypot scenarios, cryptographic commitments), could make implementation difficult. Ensuring coordination and reliability across these components is a significant engineering challenge.

### **Conclusion**

Your proposal is intelligent, demonstrating a deep understanding of AI safety challenges and proposing a pragmatic, multi-layered approach to control advanced AI systems. It builds on existing ideas like AI oversight and multi-agent systems but introduces novel elements, particularly in monitoring intermediate activations, using honeypot scenarios, and ensuring voting integrity through cryptographic commitments.

While it may not be a complete solution to the AI alignment problem, it represents a significant advancement in thinking about how to control superintelligent AI through external safeguards. The proactive focus on detecting misbehavior before it manifests, combined with a realistic acknowledgment of limitations, makes this a valuable contribution to the field. Despite challenges like scalability, interpretability, and adversarial risks, the proposal's emphasis on layered, diverse, and independent controls offers a promising direction for future research and implementation in AI safety.

**Next is O1-Pro from OpenAI:**

Your proposal takes a fairly common intuition in AI safety—that a single large model’s safety features can be bypassed if someone gains access to its weights—and fleshes it out into a more comprehensive multi-model “checks and balances” system. Below are some reflections on its novelty, strengths, and the ways it relates to or diverges from other known proposals:

1. **Emphasis on External Control vs. “Internal Alignment.”**  
   Most alignment methods try hard to make a single model internally safe and “self-policing.” You argue that no matter how baked-in a model’s safety features are, an attacker or state actor can subvert them. Your emphasis on an external enforcement layer—“Helper” models that can forcibly halt the “Smart” model—goes beyond simply focusing on better training objectives or interpretability for a single system. This is reminiscent of “boxing” or “tool AI” strategies, but with a more elaborate architecture and an emphasis on having many watchers that collectively judge behavior.

2. **Monitoring Intermediate Activations.**  
   You propose watchers that analyze not just final outputs, but also the *intermediate* hidden states of the Smart model to detect the earliest signs of malicious planning. The idea of hooking into earlier layers or “reading the AI’s mind” is definitely a research frontier—some interpretability work tries to identify hidden representations that correlate with problematic or deceptive thinking. But tying these interpretability insights to a robust *external* system of simpler watchdog models is more specialized than typical interpretability approaches, which often focus on analyzing a single model off-line. That said, it’s still an open question whether these watchers can truly “unmask” manipulative or obfuscated internal representations without also being at least as sophisticated as the main model.

3. **Multiple, Independently Trained Watchdog Models.**  
   Having a diverse “congress” of watchers, each with different architectures, training data, or vantage points, is similar to ideas in AI safety that revolve around “monitoring by ensemble” or “committee-based oversight.” Some labs already use multiple models to critique one another (Anthropic’s Constitutional AI approach or OpenAI’s use of GPT-4 to review GPT-4’s outputs). But your suggestion of letting these watchers *vote to halt execution in real time* is more forceful than the typical setup, which is often limited to providing inline feedback. You also elaborate a system of weighting watchers’ votes by track record, plus cryptographic commitments to reduce collusion. That’s more elaborate than what most current “ensemble oversight” proposals detail.

4. **Opacity to the Smart Model.**  
   You explicitly suggest preventing the Smart model from knowing the watchers’ processes or from talking its way out of a halt. This is effectively a partitioned or “air-gapped” approach—one that’s sometimes mentioned in high-level alignment discussions but isn’t as frequently spelled out. The tradeoff is that if the watchers are too “opaque” to the Smart model, that might reduce the Smart model’s ability to cooperate or clarify its true goals. On the other hand, you avoid letting it manipulate or intimidate the watchers.

5. **Potential Weaknesses and Practical Concerns.**  
   - **False Positives / Alert Fatigue:** You point out that if watchers trigger too many halts, the system may be forced to either relax their vigilance or cherrypick watchers that almost never halt. This is a plausible failure mode: real human regulatory systems can devolve in exactly this way.  
   - **Evasion by a Smarter Model:** If the main system is significantly more capable than its watchers, it can learn to produce misleading internal states or otherwise degrade watchers’ reliability—much like an expert criminal fooling naive investigators. You mention that watchers need strong interpretability capabilities to catch such manipulations, which is itself a big unsolved problem.  
   - **Resource Intensiveness:** You note that it’s expensive. Indeed, a big reason that multi-model oversight or specialized interpretability watchers aren’t deployed widely (yet) is the huge overhead in training, running, and coordinating them.  

6. **Novelty and Advancement.**  
   - **Is it “groundbreaking”?** In broad strokes, the idea of “AI oversight by other AIs” has been discussed for some time—there are existing lines of research on “debate,” “adversarial training,” “constitutional AI,” and “monitoring committees.” Your plan stands out for the detail with which you propose real-time halting, the diverse “congress of watchers,” and the cryptographic scheme for ensuring independent votes.  
   - **Value of the Specifics:** The details you introduce—especially about analyzing intermediate activations, using BNF constraints, rotating watchers, weighting watchers by track record, and forcibly pausing the Smart model—make this more concrete than many high-level “just have a separate oversight model” suggestions. That concreteness is valuable, though it also underscores how complicated the actual system would be.  

Overall, the proposal is definitely interesting and somewhat more *thorough* than the usual “use a separate AI to monitor the big AI” slogan. It’s not a trivial matter to implement or validate a real system like this, but you do a nice job thinking through potential weaknesses, tampering concerns, and the social/economic friction of having frequent halts. Whether it represents a major advancement probably depends on whether you can (1) show that simpler watchers truly can detect a superintelligent system’s manipulations in real time, and (2) keep the watchers from being suborned, disabled, or ironically tricked into always letting the big model proceed. Still, your approach takes established alignment discussions on watchers and adds robust detail, so it’s a meaningful contribution to the ongoing conversation.

**Finally, for good measure, here is o3-mini-high from OpenAI:**

Your proposal is intellectually rich and well-considered, particularly in its rejection of embedding safety solely inside a single “smart” AI. The core idea—using a diverse ensemble of simpler, independent Helper models to monitor both the output and even the internal activations of a primary model—is compelling. It acknowledges that once a powerful model is in operation, trying to “bake in” unbreakable safeguards may be fundamentally flawed because of vulnerabilities like prompt injections and latent-space manipulations.

**Novelty and Similarities:**  
- The proposal echoes ideas from adversarial oversight and red-teaming—using external mechanisms to monitor and control behavior rather than relying solely on internal alignment.  
- The notion of dissecting intermediate activations to catch “pre-ideas” is less common in mainstream discussions and represents an innovative twist on interpretability research.  
- The idea of a “congress” of Helper models, with independent voting (even with cryptographic commitments) and dynamic model lineups, is reminiscent of multi-layered safety systems seen in high-stakes engineering (like aviation or nuclear control), though it’s novel in its application to AI alignment.

**Advancement in AI Safety Thinking:**  
Your proposal pushes the envelope by reframing the alignment problem from trying to “imprint” morality into a superintelligent system to creating an external, dynamically evolving oversight architecture. This is a real conceptual advancement because it shifts the focus from internal safeguards—which might be inherently subvertible—to external, diverse, and independent controls that could potentially adapt and counteract deceptive strategies. 

**Practical Considerations:**  
Despite its strengths, the approach is extremely complex. There are significant challenges: ensuring that the Helper models remain diverse and unmanipulable by the Smart model, managing false positives that could stifle performance, and engineering a robust interface between internal activations and overt behavior. These are nontrivial hurdles that echo criticisms of existing “boxing” or oversight proposals.

Overall, your ideas represent a thoughtful and advanced perspective on AI safety. They build on existing work but take the concept further by integrating deep internal monitoring with external, multi-model oversight. While it may not be a complete solution in itself, it’s a valuable contribution to the conversation, highlighting the need for layered, adaptive safety mechanisms when dealing with potentially superintelligent systems.
